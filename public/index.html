					<p>Many sites, roadways, towns and urban areas have been equipped with analog or IP-based CCTV cameras for surveillance purposes. But many of these cameras do not have Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) software built in, and so they donât have the capacity to manage access and control over a given perimeter. This means you canât easily measure lengths of stay, search for a specific vehicle at a large parking site, measure average speed on a highway or in a town, or generate many other useful statistics. Moreover, if you want to upgrade systems, no one will refund you the money invested in your current cameras.</p>
					<p>Limbio PROD could be the answer for you. Limbio PROD will help you evaluate whether ANPR technology is for you and make a decision about integrating such a service without changing the cameras you are currently using. For videos up to 300 MB, our service will always be at no cost. Until May 15, you can also use this service for videos up to 2 GB absolutely free of charge.</p>
					<p>Just upload your video file at http://anpr.limbio.cloud and Limbio PROD will send back the resulting information in an Excel file with vehicle plates identified by number and country of origin. After trying Limbio PROD, you will in a better position to decide whether NPR (Number Plate Recognition) is essential to your business.</p>
					<p>Our service could also provide insights into ANPR usage to monitor the perimeter of your site and help you decide whether to have cloud- and ANPR-based analytics at your facility.</p>
